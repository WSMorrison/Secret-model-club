#SKRT model klub

SKRT model klub is a satire leaning website for a scale modelers. It is an alternative to obsolete magazines, aging forums, unfocused social media, and musty in-person clubs. SKRT model klub targets people who want to keep up to date with the hobby and their friends, but are frustrated with a flood of unqualified users and creators on other platforms. It will provide a way for users to find the appropriate Discord server for keeping informed about industry news, as well as keeping up with what their friends are working on. It will also give information on in person meetings and swap meets.

##Features

The header of the site will include a sticky navigation bar that will allow the user to jump from one section to another on the single page, scrolling website.

The site will be divided into three sections.

The SKRT online section will include links to the appropriate channels in a Discord server.

    The Modeling News component will link out to a channel focused on discussing upcoming, rereleased, newly discovered kits, parts, supplies, events, and other industrty news.

    The On The Bench component will link out to a channel focused on what members are working on, in progress projects, member help, ideas, and reference material.

    The Stash Inspection component will link out to a channel focused on showing and discussion of new kits, materials, tools and other model related gear newly acquired by members.

The SKRT hideout section will include information about local in person events.

    Station Meetings will give information about monthly meetings, including a Google Maps link.

    Beer of the Month will give a quick workbench beer suggestion.

    Annual Adjustment will give information about an annual meeting where members can trade, sell, or buy kits, supplies or tools to keep the size of their stash in balance and maybe find something rare they were looking for.

SKRT transmissions section will allow a user to sign up for a focused email newsletter. They will be able to input their email address, as well as select as few or as many categories for what content they will see in their inbox using checkboxes.

The footer of the website will include a link to the Discord server that contains the separate channels.

The footer will also include three links disguised as social media links. The links will all go to the same page, "Socialswarning.html," a simple page that indicates that the club is a  secret and therefore is not on social media.

###Features left to implement

Clicking a link on the Socials Warning page will close the tab, and return you to the main page.

The nav bar will become transparant while scrolling.

##Testing

SHOW THE PAGE ON VARIOUS DEVICES.
TALK ABOUT SHARING THE PAGE WITH SOME MODEL BUILDING FRIENDS FOR INPUT.
ANY BUGS I HAD TO FIX
Responsiveness was bad at first. Had to reorganize DIVs and change styling to use predominantly min-width rules.
